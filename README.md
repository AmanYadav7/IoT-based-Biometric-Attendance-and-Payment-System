# IoT-Based-Biometric-Attendace-with-Payment-System
The physical attendance and payment system procured issues like ghost workers, fake attendance records, payout fraud, etc. Our IoT-based Biometric attendance and payment system will take attendance on-site and ensure a reduction in delays in payments and efficiency in payments. Our system consists of a fingerprint sensor(R307) which is used to scan the fingerprint of the individual, and then we will register the individualâ€™s fingerprint and store their data securely. After that, when the individual comes to work, the entry time and the exit time of the worker will be updated and recorded. Then it automatically calculates how much money we have to pay to that individual based on the work duration calculated.

## Key features
* The IoT integrates the fingerprint sensor data to be recorded and updated in Google Sheets sent via Pushingbox API.
* The real-time deployment of the prototype helps in accurate and efficient attendance recording.
* Biometric attendance eliminates time fraud.
* The prototype automates the process of identification as well as delivers high accuracy rates.
* The automated system also mitigates payout fraud.
